SyntaxError: (irb):2: syntax error, unexpected ')', expecting '}'
  from /usr/local/rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-rc2/bin/irb:16:in `<main>'
  
  This means that there is an error.
  There is a round bracket ')' when a } was expected so go back an look 
  where you used a bracket to close and it might be either highlighted or underlined
